# .htaccess for Next.js on Hostinger
#
# This file tells the Hostinger server to forward all incoming traffic
# to your running Node.js application.
#

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On

  # This is the main rule. It captures every incoming request (.*) and forwards it
  # to your Node.js application's internal port.
  # The [P,L] flags mean "Proxy" (pass it through) and "Last" (stop processing rules).
  #
  # IMPORTANT: You MUST replace YOUR_NODE_APP_PORT with the actual port number
  # provided in your Hostinger Node.js control panel.
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://127.0.0.1:YOUR_NODE_APP_PORT/$1 [P,L]
